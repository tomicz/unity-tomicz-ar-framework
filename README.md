# About

**TOMICZ AR Framework** is a set of tools that helps developers rapidly build AR experiences. As I created countless AR applications I noticed that I always do things from scratch agan and again which consumes too much of time. Using this framework you will be able to create an AR application in few minutes.

# Dependencies
   
  **IMPORTANT!** All requirements will be installed automatically, You are not required to manually install any of the listed packages. 
   
  * Unity 2020+
  * ARFoundation
  * Universal Renderer Pipeline.
  
  The reason why Universal RP is a required dependency is because Unity is moving towards URP and HDRP. In the future you may not be able to use built-in renderer so it's the best practice to get used to new Unity's renderers. HDRP is the best used for high-end devices like PC or Console, while URP is built for low-end devices like Mobile which is the only enviroment where this framework can run on.
