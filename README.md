# About

**tomicz-ar-framework** is a set of tools that helps developers to build rapidly AR experiences. As I created countless of AR applications I noticed that I always do things from scratch which consumes too much of my time. As a result I am creating this framework to not having to re[ate myself when creating a new AR project.
