# About

**TOMICZ AR Framework** is a set of tools that helps developers rapidly build AR experiences. As I created countless AR applications I noticed that I always do things from scratch agan and again which consumes too much of time. Using this framework you will be able to create an AR application in few minutes.

# Requirements
   
  **IMPORTANT!** All requirements will be installed automatically (see Getting Started), **DO NOT** manually install any of listed packages.
